# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi Everyone!

Kyle Armstrong here.  Starting out in github to try and contribute back to some open source projects.

I'm currently interested in Python, and engrossing myself in its ways, but I am often working on shell scripts, VB.NET,
and VBA for Excel code on a semi regular basis.

To those that stumble upon this page, feel free to reach out, always willing to lend a hand.

Have a great day!

:)
